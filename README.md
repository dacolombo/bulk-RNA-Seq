# bulk RNA-Seq Project
This a part of the project for the Trascriptomics course of the MSc Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics.

In this repository it is reported the code containing the main steps for finding differentially expressed genes between samples coming from three different tissues (brain, colon and heart). Also, the data used and the results are accessible through this repository.

The vignette for this analysis can be seen at https://dacolombo.github.io/scRNA-Seq-Substantia-Nigra/
